# Snake Game in Python with Pygame
This is a classic **Snake Game** developed using **Pygame**. In this game, the player controls a snake that eats food, growing longer as it advances. The game ends when the snake hits the screen boundaries or collides with its own body.

## Features
- **Classic Snake Game mechanics**: Snake grows longer when it eats food.
- **Increasing difficulty**: Game speed increases with each level.
- **Music and sound effects**: Background music and game over sound.
- **Game over screen**: Option to retry or quit.

## Game Controls
- **Arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right): Control the snake's movement.
- **Enter**: Restart the game after a game over.
- **Esc**: Quit the game after a game over.

## How to Play
1. Run the game by executing `snake_game.py`.
2. The game will show a start screen with a **Press Enter to Start** prompt.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and eat the food that appears on the screen.
4. The game speed will increase after every 5 points scored.
5. If the snake collides with the boundaries or itself, the game will display a "Game Over" screen with an option to **try again** or **quit**.

## Game Mechanics
- **Snake Movement**: The snake moves based on arrow key input, and the head moves in the direction chosen while the body follows.
- **Collisions**:
  - If the snake hits the boundaries of the game window, or its body, the game is over.
- **Score**: The score increases by 1 for every piece of food the snake eats.
- **Levels**: The level increases with the score and makes the snake move faster.
